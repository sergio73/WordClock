# WordClock
This was a clock that I made for my girlfriend as a gift. It shows the time with words instead of numbers, and once in a year, when her birthday comes, turns on the words "Feliz cumpleaños" (happy birthday) and it brights all day while it is doing a rainbow animation, until the day ends and everything come back to normal.

Anyone is free to copy the code and use it in your project. If you have doubts, don´t hesitate in contact with me! :)

This is the final result:
